# NetworkVisualizer — Project Plan

## Overview

A web-based, Dockerised network visualizer for a Meraki home network.
Devices are discovered automatically via the Meraki Dashboard API. The topology
is stored in a SQLite database and displayed in an interactive web UI using
Cytoscape.js. Rooms act as grouping containers; devices can be assigned to rooms
via a dropdown. A manual "Rescan" button triggers fresh discovery.

## Feature Checklist

### Phase 1 — Foundation
- [x] Git repo initialised with `.gitignore` and `.env.example`
- [x] `pyproject.toml` configured with `uv`
- [x] `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` created
- [x] `README.md` written with setup and run instructions
- [x] `plan/` directory with AGENTS.md, PLAN.md, DECISIONS.md, tasks/

### Phase 2 — Discovery
- [x] Meraki SDK client (`src/discovery/meraki_client.py`)
- [x] Fetch organisations and networks
- [x] Fetch all devices (MX, MS, MR)
- [x] Fetch switch ports with speed, VLAN, PoE capable, PoE active
- [x] Fetch CDP/LLDP neighbour data per port
- [x] Handle unmanaged/unknown devices on ports

### Phase 3 — Database
- [x] SQLAlchemy models: `Device`, `Port`, `Link`, `Room`, `DeviceRoom`
- [x] Managed and unmanaged device support (name, type, port count, notes, MAC, IP)
- [x] `reset_db()` utility
- [x] `seed_from_discovery()` utility

### Phase 4 — API
- [x] `POST /scan` — trigger full Meraki rescan
- [x] `GET /topology` — return full graph JSON for frontend
- [x] `PATCH /device/{id}` — annotate unmanaged device
- [x] `PATCH /device/{id}/room` — assign device to room
- [x] `DELETE /db` — reset database (with confirmation token)

### Phase 5 — Frontend
- [x] Cytoscape.js flat graph (devices + links, no compound nodes)
- [x] Port detail side-panel (PoE capable/active, speed, VLAN, neighbour)
- [x] Room assignment via colour-coded border rings + legend panel
- [x] Room dropdown reassignment with inline "new room" creation
- [x] "Rescan Network" button with spinner
- [x] "Reset Layout" button (clears localStorage positions)
- [x] "Reset Database" button with confirmation prompt
- [x] Unmanaged device annotation form (name, type, port count, notes, MAC, IP)
- [x] Node positions persisted in localStorage; auto-layout on first load
- [x] Edge labels show source port number; colours by link type (LLDP/CDP/manual)

### Phase 6 — Docker & Docs
- [x] Finalised Dockerfile (python:3.12-slim + uv)
- [x] docker-compose.yml with named SQLite volume and .env injection
- [x] README.md complete with Future Development section

---

## Post-Launch Fixes

- [x] Meraki API `productTypes` filter — sensors/cameras excluded at API level
- [x] LLDP link resolution via MAC address matching (not serial/name)
- [x] MAC ±offset resolution for Meraki AP radio vs management MAC
- [x] CDP hostname matching for non-Meraki devices (e.g. Catalyst 9800-L)
- [x] Bidirectional LLDP deduplication
- [x] Removed compound/parent room nodes (caused large overlapping boxes)
- [x] Room membership shown via node border ring colour + legend

---

## Future Development (Post-Phase-6)

- Cisco Catalyst support (SSH/NETCONF)
- Drag-and-drop room layout repositioning (Option C — two-level view)
- Continuous background polling option
- MCP server integration for richer agent tooling
- Port utilisation history / change log
- Export topology as image or PDF
